# Welcome to my first Computer Science project with CodeCademy. 
# In this file, I have created a coin flip game. 
# It's a bit messy, for example, the formatting of the output is not consistent. 
#    There are some 5 second breaks, for example, and some 0.5 second breaks if I remember correctly. 
#    Additionally, the "----------" characters which you could call 'borders' are not consistent.
# On top of that, the code is not well documented so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

# One thing I think I did well in this program is planning for contingencies,
#    for example, if the user entered an input that was not supposed to be entered,
#    it would print some kind of error message and they had the option to try again.

# Another thing I think I did well was allow for the user to 
# reset the game, so that their stats would erase and start at zero again. 
# For example, see line 56 and 66, and line 145 and 171. 


# I would be interested in learning how this program could be improved, so feedback is welcomed.
# Questions are also welcomed however I may not respond to all (fair warning). 
# Hope you found this helpful or interesting!
